# Hangman project
This is a Hangman project done as part of the Data Science Bootcamp primer from the WBS Coding school.

It's highly recommended to creates a separate environment to install the requirements and avoid changing any installed software in your system. 

install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

start hangman with the command:
```bash
bash start_hangman.sh
```
